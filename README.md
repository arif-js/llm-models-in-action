Playing with Ollama open source models to create: 
1. sql_bot: You can connect your database. And ask database related questions to the llm models.
2. sql_and_conversational_bot: You can ask questions. The llm first identify what you are asking. If you are asking general questions, or if you are asking sql related questions about your connected database, the llm will answer accordingly.
3. linkedin_scrapper: Used selenium, ollama, soap to scrap linkedin profile details and summerize.
